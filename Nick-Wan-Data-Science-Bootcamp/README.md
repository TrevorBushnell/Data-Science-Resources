# Nick Wan Data Science Bootcamp

Contains all my notes and answers for the Nick Wan data science bootcamp. Each notebook is sorted by day. I also take notes on all the concepts that Nick explains in his videos. 

YouTube playlist for VODs of each day can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zmd7zuRm6E&list=PL6PX3YIZuHhwo48MyTASIor4j5NV7qq1W).

## Downloading the Data

The data was too big for me to install off of Google Drive, so run `get_data.sh` to download the data that Nick Wan provides. (must have Python installed in order to download data).
